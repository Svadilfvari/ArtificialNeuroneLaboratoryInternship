# MATLAB Simulation of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) Neurons

## Overview

This project implements a biologically inspired simulation of Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neurons using MATLAB. It serves as a lightweight and fast alternative to traditional Cadence circuit simulations, offering significant speedup with acceptable accuracy.

## Motivation

Conventional neuromorphic circuit simulations using tools like **Cadence** are highly accurate but computationally expensive, often requiring **up to 24 hours** to simulate a single neuron. This project leverages MATLAB to achieve the same simulation goals in **just a few minutes**.

## Key Features

- âœ… **Biologically Inspired**: Based on the LIF model, mimicking neuronal charge-discharge behavior.
- âš¡ **Efficient**: Reduces simulation time from ~1 day to minutes.
- ðŸŽ¯ **Accurate**: Achieves a **9.2% RMSPE (Root Mean Square Percentage Error)** compared to Cadence.
- ðŸ“ˆ **Data-Driven**: Uses interpolated data from Cadence to model frequency and power behavior.
- ðŸ”§ **Customizable**: Spike shape and response frequency are configurable using polynomial fitting.
